# Module 17: Javascript Regular Expressions(Regex)

As a web development student, I have developed this tutorial, where you will learn about the Regex abbreviation of Regular Expression and how you can use it to identify characters in a text.

## Summary

Regex or Regular Expressions are patterns used to identify combinations or characters in a string, they can be used to validate text based on complex criteria, and they can also be used to replace patterns of the character in a string.

In this tutorial we are going to use this Email:
         /^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/ 
as an example of how to breakdown some Regular Expression examples and how to use it.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors have special meaning in regular expressions. They do not match any character. Instead, they match a position before or after characters:

 ^ – The caret anchor matches the beginning of the text.
 $ – The dollar anchor matches the end of the text.
