# Regex Tutorial

As a web development student, I have developed this tutorial, where you will learn about the Regex abbreviation of Regular Expression and how you can use it to identify characters in a text.

Regex or Regular Expressions are patterns used to identify combinations or characters in a string, they can be used to validate text based on complex criteria, and they can also be used to replace patterns of the character in a string.
